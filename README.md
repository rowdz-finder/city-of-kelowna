# City of Kelowna Bike Network Analysis

In 2018, the City of Kelowna entered into a license agreement with Dropbike to operate a dockless bikeshare pilot in and around the downtown core. The bikes were tracked by the user’s cell phone GPS through the Dropbike app. The City’s Active Transportation team recognized that this GPS data could help the City understand the routes used by cyclists which would then inform decision-making for infrastructure improvements. Using OSMnx and NetworkX in Python we converted the map of Kelowna into a graph network to map inaccurate, infrequent GPS points to the nearest street intersection, calculate the potential paths taken by cyclists and count the number of trips by street segment. Combined with the data from four counters around downtown, we used a mixed effects statistical model and a least squares optimization to estimate a relationship between the very different traffic patterns of the bikeshare and counter data. That relationship was used to estimate and visualize the Annual Daily Bicycle volume in downtown Kelowna. This visualization helped us understand how the bike network was being used, how cyclists crossed Highway 97 and how laneways were used by cyclists.
